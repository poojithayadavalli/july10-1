# Binary search tree # searching

Rohan is learning about trees and he wants to test his knowledge on trees by constructing a BinarySearch Tree

from the list which contains the following:

a)the elements in the list are the pairs of numbers whose sum is equal to n in sorted order
b)the list do not contain duplicate numbers and negative numbers if exists then ignore

Contraints:

	2<=n<=10000
  
input format:

 	first line contains array of numbers
 	second line contains number n
  
output format:

 	inorder traversal of BinarySearch Tree if list is not empty else print -1

Examples:

input:

3 4 5

9

output:

4 5

input:

3 3 4 2 1

6

output:

3 2 4

input:

3 4 5 2

10

output:

-1
